# GPR20: VNA Holder
Repository for the VNA Holder group of the GPR-20 robot. This repository contains the files for the mechanical components associated to the robot VNA holder.

## Repository Organization
The repository is organized as follows:
- **IPT (./ipt/):** contains the source editable files for the VNA Holder group components. These files are intended to be used in [Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview).
- **STL (./stl/):** contains the ready-to-use files for the VNA Holder group components. These files can be used in a slicer software to manufacture the components using a 3D printer.
- **Assemblies (./assemblies/):** contains an assembly file to be used in [Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview) that illustrates how the parts are used together. A subfolder is also included to store additional miscelaneus files for the assembly.
